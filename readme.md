# Getting Started with Scss
This mini-project was created for an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@tarikmerrylees/getting-started-with-scss-d3937d9e247c). It outlines how on can get started using scss.
If you have scss installed locally and wish to run this project's sass watch, use the usual command for Sass:
```
sass - watch scss:css
```
